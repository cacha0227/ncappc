NCA metrics are eatimated according to traditional PK calculations. The names of the various NCA metrics estimated in this package are assigned mainly following the names used in WinNonlin. This package accepts any of the three different types of drug administration, (i) iv-bolus, (ii) iv-infusion and (iii) extravascular; ***ncappc*** also can accept both non-steady state and steady-state data. The NCa metric that are estimated and reported by ***ncappc*** are listed below.

**C0**  
C0 is the initial concentration at the dosing time. It is the observed concentration at the dosing time, if available. Otherwise it is approximated using the following rules. For iv-bolus data, log-linear back-extrapolation (*see "backExtrap" argument*) is performed from the first two observations to estimate C0, provided the local slope is negative. However, if the slope is >=0 or at least one of the first two concentrations is 0, the first non-zero concentration is used as C0. For other types of administration, C0 is equal to 0 for non steady-state data and for steady-state data the minimum value observed between the dosing intervals is used to estimate C0, provided the "backExtrap" argument is set to "yes".

**Cmax, Tmax and Cmax_D**  
Cmax and Tmax are the value and the time of maximum observed concentration, respectively. If the maximum concentration is not unique, the first maximum is used. For steady state data, The maximum value between the dosing intervals is considered. Cmax_D is the dose normalized maximum observed concentration.

**Clast and Tlast**  
Clast and Tlast are the last measurable positive comcentration and the corresponding time, respectively.

**AUClast**  
The area under the concentration vs. time curve from the first observed to last measurable concentration.

**AUMClast**  
The area under the first moment of the concentration vs. time curve from the first observed to last measurable concentration.

**MRTlast**  
Mean residence time from the first observed to last measurable concentration. For non-infusion models,  
$MRTlast = \frac{AUMClast}{AUClast}$  
For infusion models,  
$MRTlast = \frac{AUMClast}{AUClast}-\frac{TI}{2}$  
where TI is the infusion duration.

No_points_Lambda_z is the number of observed data points used to determine the best fitting regression line in the elimination phase.

**AUClower_upper**

**Rsq, Rsq_adjusted and Corr_XY**  
Regression coefficient of the regression line used to estimate the elimination rate constant. Rsq_adjusted is the adjusted value of Rsq given by the following relation.  
$Rsq\_adjusted = 1-\frac{(1-Rsq^2)*(n-1)}{n-2}$  
where *n* is the number of points in the regression line. Corr_XY is the square root of Rsq.
